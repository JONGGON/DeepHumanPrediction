Why create an original C3D file with bvh using Motionbuilder?

Bvh has the corresponding motion data in the hierarchy structure.

The bvh file I downloaded from the web had its own hierarchy structure. This is hard to use.

so!!! I made the data according to my hierarchy structure for the unification of the hirerarchy structure.

I also studied a lot about Motion Builder.

One more thing to watch out for (the most important thing in some ways)
C3D files also have different number of markers. So through MotionBuilder We need to create an object by unifying the number of markers, 
and add the skeleton to the object and extract it as BVH.
